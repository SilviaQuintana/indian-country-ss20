      One of these ways of life is the traditional birthing methods of the Inuit that utilize midwifery. These traditional methods refer to a midwifery system in which women give birth at home within the family group

     This forced removal of women from their home community during childbirth has had numerous negative effects on Inuit communities. These communities have begun actively resisting the Canadian government by establishing medical facilities of their own and keeping women in the Inuit community during childbirth.

<h3>History of Inuit Midwifery</h3>
<hr>
  <p> The Inuit were a completely autonomous group of people in the arctic regions of present-day Canada. Their communities consisted of small nomadic groups of hunters that relied on caribou, fish, sea mammals, and the occasional gathering of berries (The Inuit Way). Traditional Inuit culture relied on a form of customary law based on social pressure conducted through the community and elders. The laws practiced were based on culturally specific values and beliefs. </p>

  </figure>

    <p> The introduction of Europeans to the arctic regions of Canada changed the Inuit culture dramatically as the fur trade infiltrated the Inuit autonomous economic structure. Inuit people became more reliant on the products Europeans brought to trade with, and they became necessities in the newly transformed Inuit culture
       <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada. (2006). The Inuit Way: A Guide to Inuit Culture.">(Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada 2006)</a>.
    The intervention of the settler-colonial government of Canada also had a lasting effect on Inuit culture as their families were torn apart through mandatory residential schooling for Inuit children and customary law was replaced with the Royal Canadian Mountain Police

  <p> Increasing intervention by the Canadian government has impacted the Inuit in several ways. One of the major interventions on Inuit culture,made by the Canadian government, involved the traditional birthing methods of the Inuit. Traditional birthing methods varied across Inuit communities but consisted of a midwife system. Inuit childbirth “embodied an ethic of self-sufficiency or a belief in the mother’s active role in achieving a good outcome,” (Bronstein 2015, pg. 26). Starting in the 19th century, European missionaries began providing healthcare but the main intervention came from the government (Bronstein 2015). In 1904, Dr. Peter Bryce, Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Indian Affairs, claimed that high rates of infection for children at birth were due to Indigneous birthing rituals (Bronstein 2015). </p>

  <p>This led the Canadian government to feel that action needed to be taken to save Inuit babies and mothers. With the increase of biomedicalization in the first half of the 20th century, more interventions such as nurse visitors and Canadian established nursing stations appeared in Inuit communities.

    </figure>
  The nursing stations did not take community input into consideration and believed that the Inuit people were unable to provide care or seek it out marking it as a paternalistic project by the government (Bronstein 2015). These groups relied on the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) to determine risk of Inuit births. In the 1950s, it was found that Inuit IMR was the highest of any ethnic group in Canada and surveys conducted in the 1960s blamed the midwifery system for high mortality (Bronstein 2015). </p>


    <p> The Canadian government moved to evacuate pregnant women from the arctic region to southern hospitals to give birth as their nursing stations were ill staffed, and they saw Canadian biomedicine as the only viable way to deal with IMR. By 1980, 98% of Inuit pregnant women were forced to hospitals in southern Canada to give birth (Bronstein 2015). This practice completely demolished the cultural practices of community birth by midwives and families. It was also expensive and many of the Inuit women were unable to converse effectively with southern healthcare workers (Bronstein 2015). By sending women south, it obilerated their culture and autonomy and often created additional problems such as social dislocation, poor diet, family stress, child neglect, and rising substance abuse among Inuit communities (Van Wagner et. al 2007). </p>

<h3> Present Day: Resistance and Reclaiming of Indigenous Midwifery </h3>
<hr>
<p> Rather than creating a solution, the Canadian government created more complications for the Inuit community. Results of studies throughout the 1970s showed that it was actually safer [for infants] to be born in Inuit communities than to live there for the first year of life, and issues of postnatal education, health services, and support are critical (Baskett, 1978, p. 1004). Inuit women are subject to the social determinants of systemic racism, evident in health care that is not culturally appropriate and that fails to provide relevant services in accessible languages, socioeconomic status which compounds the economic costs and stress of evacuation, and gendered norms which subject them to the patriarchal authority of the medical profession and double duties of working and providing domestic and childcare labour (NAHO, 2006, p. 15).</p>

<p> The course of action turns around the title character and a gathering cast of his maritime sidekicks. SpongeBob SquarePants is a blazing and confident sea wipe who physically takes after a rectangular kitchen wipe. He lives in a submerged pineapple with his pet snail Gary, who whines like a cat. SpongeBob has an uncorrupt energy perpetually, which proceeds to his movement as a fry cook at a drive-through diner called the Krusty Krab. His most conspicuous target in life is to get a license to drive a boatmobile. His favored recreation exercises fuse “jellyfishing”, which incorporates getting jellyfish with a net in a manner like butterfly getting, and blowing chemical ascents into explain shapes.</p>

<p> Living two houses down from SpongeBob is his nearest partner Patrick Star, a boneheaded yet welcoming pink starfish who abides under a stone. Despite his mental troubles, Patrick still believes himself to be vigilant.</p>

<p> Squidward Tentacles, SpongeBob’s close by neighbor and teammate at the Krusty Krab, is a pretentious and touchy octopus who lives in an Easter Island moai. He values playing the clarinet and painting self-pictures, yet hates his movement as a representative and repugnances living among SpongeBob and Patrick, in view of their juvenile nature. The owner of the Krusty Krab is a closefisted red crab named Eugene H. Krabs who talks like a sailor and runs his diner just as it were a privateer dispatch. Mr. Krabs is a lone parent with one youthful young lady, a sperm whale named Pearl, to whom he needs to go down his riches. Pearl doesn’t want to continue with the secretly run organization and would want to put her vitality checking out well known music or working at the area mall.</p>

<p> Another friend of SpongeBob is Sandy Cheeks, a surge pursuing and athletic squirrel from Texas, who wears an air-filled diving suit to breathe in submerged. She lives in an oak tree entrapped in an unquestionable glass curve dashed by a water/air verification, hand-turned seal and is an authority in karate, similarly as a specialist.</p>
