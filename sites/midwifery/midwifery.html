      One of these ways of life is the traditional birthing methods of the Inuit that utilize midwifery. These traditional methods refer to a midwifery system in which women give birth at home within the family group

     This forced removal of women from their home community during childbirth has had numerous negative effects on Inuit communities. These communities have begun actively resisting the Canadian government by establishing medical facilities of their own and keeping women in the Inuit community during childbirth.

<h3>History of Inuit Midwifery</h3>
<hr>
  <p> The Inuit were a completely autonomous group of people in the arctic regions of present-day Canada. Their communities consisted of small nomadic groups of hunters that relied on caribou, fish, sea mammals, and the occasional gathering of berries (The Inuit Way). Traditional Inuit culture relied on a form of customary law based on social pressure conducted through the community and elders. The laws practiced were based on culturally specific values and beliefs. </p>

  </figure>

    <p> The introduction of Europeans to the arctic regions of Canada changed the Inuit culture dramatically as the fur trade infiltrated the Inuit autonomous economic structure. Inuit people became more reliant on the products Europeans brought to trade with, and they became necessities in the newly transformed Inuit culture

    The intervention of the settler-colonial government of Canada also had a lasting effect on Inuit culture as their families were torn apart through mandatory residential schooling for Inuit children and customary law was replaced with the Royal Canadian Mountain Police

  <p> Increasing intervention by the Canadian government has impacted the Inuit in several ways. One of the major interventions on Inuit culture,made by the Canadian government, involved the traditional birthing methods of the Inuit. Traditional birthing methods varied across Inuit communities but consisted of a midwife system. Inuit childbirth “embodied an ethic of self-sufficiency or a belief in the mother’s active role in achieving a good outcome,”

  Starting in the 19th century, European missionaries began providing healthcare but the main intervention came from the government

   In 1904, Dr. Peter Bryce, Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Indian Affairs, claimed that high rates of infection for children at birth were due to Indigneous birthing rituals

  <p>This led the Canadian government to feel that action needed to be taken to save Inuit babies and mothers. With the increase of biomedicalization in the first half of the 20th century, more interventions such as nurse visitors and Canadian established nursing stations appeared in Inuit communities.

  The nursing stations did not take community input into consideration and believed that the Inuit people were unable to provide care or seek it out marking it as a paternalistic project by the government
    <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bronstein, T. (2015). “Bringing Birth Home: An Analysis of Inuit Birthing Practices and Policies.” McGill Journal of Global Health (the Prognosis) 26-33.">(Bronstein 2015)</a>.
  These groups relied on the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) to determine risk of Inuit births. In the 1950s, it was found that Inuit IMR was the highest of any ethnic group in Canada and surveys conducted in the 1960s blamed the midwifery system for high mortality

    <p> The Canadian government moved to evacuate pregnant women from the arctic region to southern hospitals to give birth as their nursing stations were ill staffed, and they saw Canadian biomedicine as the only viable way to deal with IMR. By 1980, 98% of Inuit pregnant women were forced to hospitals in southern Canada to give birth

    This practice completely demolished the cultural practices of community birth by midwives and families. It was also expensive and many of the Inuit women were unable to converse effectively with southern healthcare workers

    By sending women south, it obilerated their culture and autonomy and often created additional problems such as social dislocation, poor diet, family stress, child neglect, and rising substance abuse among Inuit communities

<h3> Present Day: Resistance and Reclaiming of Indigenous Midwifery </h3>
<hr>
<p> Rather than creating a solution, the Canadian government created more complications for the Inuit community. Interesting enough, “[r]esults of studies throughout the 1970s showed that it was actually safer [for infants] to be born in Inuit communities ….” (Baskett, 1978, p. 1004). Inuit women are subject[ed] to the social determinants of systemic racism, evident in health care that is not culturally appropriate and that fails to provide relevant services in accessible languages, socioeconomic status which compounds the economic costs and stress of evacuation, and gendered norms which subject them to the patriarchal authority of the medical profession and double duties of working and providing domestic and childcare labour (NAHO, 2006, p. 15). In order to mitigate the negative effects of these enforced evacuations and the silencing of Indigenous midwifery practices, the government has tried to make fundings of several programs to reinstate Inuit midwifery to reconcile for the damages done.</p>

<p> Programs like the Inuulitsivik Maternities in Nunavik, QC and the Rankin Inlet Birthing Centre in Rankin Inlet, NU, have paved the way in recruiting Inuit women and incorporating Inuit knowledge on childbirth. If we take a closer look at one of the community-based programs, Inuulitsivik Maternities, opened their doors in September 1986. Infant mortality rates have fallen from 8.6% to 3.6% as of 2006, and several thousand births have safely occurred at the Maternities since 1986 (Kileda, 2006, p. 392). There are fewer premature and low birth weight deliveries reported, with rates of complications and birth interventions decreasing significantly when “the majority of births began occurring at the Maternities instead of in Southern hospitals” (Douglas, 2006, p. 127; Houd, Qinuajuak, & Epoo, 2004, p. 239).</p>

<p> This was due to an extensive amount of work by conducting public surveys, dialogues, and consulting Inuit communities, specifically, involving elders. Elders feared losing important traditional practices because of the inability to pass them down. However, becoming actively involved in helping Maternities in reviewing taboos, traditions, and childbirth practices created a system that is entirely medicalized, yet, Inuit. The Innulisivik Maternities “[operated] as a “midwifery-led collaborative model of care” using midwives, nurses, and physicians as a multi-disciplinary team” (NACM, n.d., p. 7).</p>

<p> So how exactly does this work? The Midwifery Education Program uses a modular competency based curriculum, consistent with that of southern midwifery education programs but adapted to the realities of northern practice (NAHO, 2008, p. 33). Classroom education, hands-on apprenticeship training, and a mentor/mentee system between students and the Maternities’ midwives form the backbone of this program (Daviss, 1997, p. 451; 462). As mentioned before, students work with elders in different communities to learn about their storytelling and oral methods of teaching, creating a learning environment where they can take these teachings to advocate for those who live in remote areas and face language barriers. This in return creates a safe environment for patients who feel that they can interact with health care services in a healthy way. There is an understanding that learning takes place not only in a clinical or academic setting, but rather is a holistic experience encompassing the home, community, and land (Epoo et al., 2012, p. 288). </p>

<p> Midwives during training to be able to fully graduate, “..... need (sic) to have followed [a] pregnancy, birth, and postpartum care for a minimum of sixty women, attend at least forty births as second attendant, have a minimum of 1240 supervised clinical hours, and pass structured clinical written exams for each module” (Carroll & Benoit, 2004, p. 273; Epoo et al., 2012, p. 289; Van Wagner et al., 2007, p. 389).  They must further be certified in Emergency Skills, Neonatal Resuscitation, and CPR (Epoo et al., 2012, p. 289). Midwives are registered after graduation with the College of Midwives of Quebec where legislation recognizes Inuit midwives working at Inuulitsivik, although their licenses are only valid for practice within Nunavik (Carroll & Benoit, 2004, p. 273; Inuulitsivik, 2017, para. 5; Skye, 2010, p. 33).</p>

<p> The course of action turns around the title character and a gathering cast of his maritime sidekicks. SpongeBob SquarePants is a blazing and confident sea wipe who physically takes after a rectangular kitchen wipe. He lives in a submerged pineapple with his pet snail Gary, who whines like a cat. SpongeBob has an uncorrupt energy perpetually, which proceeds to his movement as a fry cook at a drive-through diner called the Krusty Krab. His most conspicuous target in life is to get a license to drive a boatmobile. His favored recreation exercises fuse “jellyfishing”, which incorporates getting jellyfish with a net in a manner like butterfly getting, and blowing chemical ascents into explain shapes.</p>

<p> Living two houses down from SpongeBob is his nearest partner Patrick Star, a boneheaded yet welcoming pink starfish who abides under a stone. Despite his mental troubles, Patrick still believes himself to be vigilant.</p>

<p> Squidward Tentacles, SpongeBob’s close by neighbor and teammate at the Krusty Krab, is a pretentious and touchy octopus who lives in an Easter Island moai. He values playing the clarinet and painting self-pictures, yet hates his movement as a representative and repugnances living among SpongeBob and Patrick, in view of their juvenile nature. The owner of the Krusty Krab is a closefisted red crab named Eugene H. Krabs who talks like a sailor and runs his diner just as it were a privateer dispatch. Mr. Krabs is a lone parent with one youthful young lady, a sperm whale named Pearl, to whom he needs to go down his riches. Pearl doesn’t want to continue with the secretly run organization and would want to put her vitality checking out well known music or working at the area mall.</p>

<p> Another friend of SpongeBob is Sandy Cheeks, a surge pursuing and athletic squirrel from Texas, who wears an air-filled diving suit to breathe in submerged. She lives in an oak tree entrapped in an unquestionable glass curve dashed by a water/air verification, hand-turned seal and is an authority in karate, similarly as a specialist.</p>
